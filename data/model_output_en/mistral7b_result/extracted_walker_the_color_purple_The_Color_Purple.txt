Shug	Samuel	Oh, my feelings were hurt! And I was mad! And that’s what I thought about, even told [MASK] about, on the way home. Not about your sister—what was her name?—Celie? Nothing about her. She began to cry in earnest.

Jim	Celie	Which I did. And words long buried in my heart crept to my lips. I stroked his dear head and face and I called him darling and dear. And I’m afraid, dear, dear [MASK], that concern and passion soon ran away with us.

Mother	Mr._____ast	She say, I’ll take the children with me. I say, Your place is with me. She say, You want to come? She keep primping in front of the glass, getting the children ready at the same time. You ever hit her? [MASK].

Mrs. Birling	Catherine	It is true that I work harder here than I ever dreamed I could work, and that 1 sweep out the school and tidy up after service, but I don’t feel like a drudge. I was surprised that this woman, whose Christian name is [MASK], saw me in this light.

Jim	Nettie	But what was good tween us must have been nothing but bodies, she say. Cause I don’t know the Albert that don’t dance, can’t hardly laugh, never talk bout nothing, beat you and hid your sister [MASK]’s letters. Who he?

Ponyboy	Harpo	[MASK]. I stick my head and my arm back in my old dress and wipe the sweat and dirt off my face as best I can. I come to the door. Yessir? I ast, and trip over the broom I was sweeping with when I first notice the wagon.

Mr. Macy	Celie	And [MASK], he told me a story that made my hair stand on end. I hope you, poor thing, are ready for it. Once upon a time, there was a well-to-do farmer who owned his own property near town.

Jim	Harpo	It more like patting another piece of wood. Not a living tree, but a table, a chifferobe. Anyhow, they don’t love me neither, no matter how good I is. They don’t mind. Cept for [MASK] they won’t work.

Ponyboy	Darlene	But I let [MASK] worry on. Sometimes I think bout the apples and the dogs, sometimes I don’t. Look like to me only a fool would want you to talk in a way that feel peculiar to your mind.

Mama	Lillie	One thing my mama hated me for was how much I love to fuck, she say. She never love to do nothing had anything to do with touching nobody, she say. I try to kiss her, she turn her mouth away. Say, Cut that out [MASK], she say.

Ponyboy	Swain	One reason is she say whatever come to mind, forgit about polite. Sometime I see him staring at her real hard when he don’t think I’m looking. One day he say, Nobody coming way out here just to hear [MASK].

T.P.	Tobias	I piece on my square. Look at the colors of the cloth. Then I hear [MASK] chair fall back and he say, Shug. Shug halfway tween sick and well. Halfway tween good and evil, too.

Mammy	Daisy	What a old sweetie pie, say [MASK], kissing him on top the head. He fondle and fondle her arm. Look at me and grin. Your daddy didn’t know how to git along, he say. Whitefolks lynch him.

Ponyboy	Celie	They still act the fool I use to be. Well, I say, we all have to start somewhere if us want to do better, and our own self is what us have to hand. I’m real sorry she left you, [MASK].

Jim	Sofia	You don’t like him cause he look like daddy, say [MASK]. I don’t feel nothing about him at all. I don’t love him, I don’t hate him. I just wish he couldn’t run loose all the time messing up folks stuff.

Jim	Nettie	These folks sure must have a heap of time just to sit and think, say Mr.______. [MASK] say they real good at thinking, I say. But they think so much in terms of thousands of years they have a hard time gitting themself through one.

Aunt Ester	Avery	Weeds come up on my land, I chop ’em up. Trash blow over it I burn it. He rise to go. Hand me his glass. Next time he come I put a little Shug [MASK] pee in his glass. See how he like that.

Ponyboy	Albert	[MASK] is not going to let you have my letters and so what use is there in writing them. That’s the way I felt when I tore them up and sent them to you on the waves. But now I feel different.

J.D.	Sofia	All these children, say the mayor’s wife, digging in her pocketbook. Cute as little buttons though, she say. She stop, put her hand on one of the children head. Say, and such strong white teef. [MASK] and the prizefighter don’t say nothing.

Mother	Celie	Yes. The roadbuilders didn’t deviate an inch from the plan the headman was following. Every hut that lay in the proposed roadpath was leveled. And, [MASK], our church, our school, my hut, all went down in a matter of hours.

Jim	Mr.	[MASK] ______come git me to take care his rotten children. He never ast me nothing bout myself. He clam on top of me and fuck and fuck, even when my head bandaged. Nobody ever love me, I say.

Jessie	Nettie	When us went to town to hear the will read yesterday, you could have knock me over with a feather. Your real daddy owned the land and the house and the store. He left it to your mama. When A Z*iZ A your mama died, it passed on to you and your sister [MASK].

Mrs. Tucker	Shug	I change the hem, I change the fullness of the leg. I make so many pants [MASK] tease me. I didn’t know what I was starting, she say, laughing. Pants all over her chairs, hanging all in front of the china closet.

Dally	Albert	After that, nothing to do but go somewhere and lay down. And funny. [MASK] was so funny. He kept me laughing. How come he ain’t funny no more? she ast. How come he never hardly laugh? How come he don’t dance?

Mama	Shug	So off us go to the restaurant. I’m so excited about being home again I don’t even notice how nervous [MASK] is. She a big graceful woman most of the time, even when she mad. But I notice she can’t git her chopsticks to work right.

Mrs. Hale	Corrine	We have built another church and school. I have another hut. And so we wait. Meanwhile, [MASK] has been very ill with African fever. Many missionaries in the past have died from it. But the children are fine.

Mrs. McClure	Mr.______feelings	Up under my car, she say. The one at home. I drove it after the oil gave out, kilt the engine. He the man fixed it. Us took one look at one nother, that was it. [MASK] hurt, I say.

Jess	Harpo	Hair notty but a lot of it, tied up on her head in a mass of plaits. She not quite as tall as [MASK] but much bigger, and strong and ruddy looking, like her mama brought her up on pork.

Mama	Sofia	But not [MASK]. She do what she want, don’t pay me no mind at all. I try to beat her, she black my eyes. Oh, boo-hoo, he cry. Boo-hoo-hoo. I start to take back my hansker.

Mother	Sofia	Anybody be sorry, he say. The woman that brought [MASK] in the world brought something. I don’t say nothing. They put her away nice, he say. They sure did, I say. And so many grandchildren, he say. Well.

Mama	Odessa	Her bigger children married and gone, and her littlest children mad at her, don’t know who she is. Think she act funny, look old and dote on that little white gal she raise. Yesterday us all had dinner at [MASK]’s house.

tin	Celie	Nothing could be uglier than corrugated tin, [MASK]. And as they struggled to put up roofs of this cold, hard, glittery, ugly metal the women raised a deafening ululation of sorrow that echoed off the cavern walls for miles around.

Jim	Sofia	He act real glad to see her. Here, pull up a chair, he say. Have a cold drink. Gimme a shot of white lightening, she say. Prizefighter pull up a chair, straddle it backwards, hug on [MASK] like they at home.

Mrs. Dalloway	Celie	She gets weaker and weaker, and unless she can believe us and start to feel something for her children, I fear we will lose her. Oh, [MASK], unbelief is a terrible thing. And so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly.

""	Shug	Don’t be a fool, [MASK] say, nudging me with her foot. You got your own house now. Your daddy and mama left it for you. That dog of a stepdaddy just a bad odor passing through. But 1 never had no house, I say.

Jim	Sofia	I don’t think she wet, say [MASK]. Just gas. But he change her anyway. Him and the baby over in a corner of the little porch out of the way of traffic. He use the old dry daidie to wipe his eyes.

Jessie	Sofia	She say it real sad, like she done run out of places to go. Thank you for all you done for us, say [MASK]. She don’t look so good herself, and a little water stand in her eyes.

Mrs. Gumm	Celie	I spoke. But just speaking to me seemed to make her embarrassed and she suddenly sort of erased herself. It was the strangest thing, [MASK]! One minute I was saying howdy to a living woman. The next minute nothing living was there. Only its shape.

J.D.	Harpo	She say, Naw, [MASK], you stay here. When you free, me and the baby be waiting. He sort of hang there between them a while, then he sit down again. I look at her face real quick then, and seem like a shadow go cross it.

Sister	Harpo	Not every night, but almost every night, from Friday to Monday. He go down to [MASK]’s to watch her sing. And just to look at her. Then way late they come home. They giggle and they talk and they rassle until morning.
