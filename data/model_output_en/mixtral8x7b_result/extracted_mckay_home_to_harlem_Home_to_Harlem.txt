Stanley	Jake	[MASK] grinned: “I’d tell you about a li’l’ piece o’ sweetness I picked up in a cabaret the first day I landed from ovah the other side. But it’s too late now. We gotta start work.”

Smeeta	Jerco	In a corner of the lowest shelf was a bundle of soiled champagne-colored silk stockings and in the other four pairs of shoes—one black velvet, one white kid, and another gold-finished. [MASK] regarded the lot with dog-like affection.

Esmeralda	Ray	The round face of the first girl, the carnal sympathy of her full, tinted mouth, touched [MASK]. But something was between them. . . . The piano-player had wandered off into some dim, far-away, ancestral source of music.

Dally	Felice	“It turn you’ hands and laigs loose for action.” “And saves you’ clothes being ripped into ribbons,” said another. A hen-fight was more fun than a cock-fight, thought [MASK], as she hastily threw her things into her bag.

Johnny	nevah	You was [ 333 ] always a good man-to-man buddy and [MASK] did wears you face bahind you. Don’t pay no mind to what I done said in that theah cabaret. Them niggers hanging around was all drunk and wouldn’t shoot their mouf off about you nohow.

Helen	Jake	Then he grew to hate that cabaret and stopped going there. The mulattress was charged with tireless activity and [MASK] was her big, good slave. But her spirit lacked the charm and verve, the infectious joy, of his little lost brown.

Johnny	Jerco	“I kain’t live without her.” “Oh yes, you can,” I said in a not very sympathetic tone. [MASK] gave me such a reproachful pathetic look that I was sorry I said it. The tall big fellow had turned into a scared, trembling baby.

Stan	Jake	Ise got a A number one little barker I’ll give it to you. You kain’t lay you’self wide open lak thataways in this heah burg. No boh!” [MASK] went home alone in a mood different from the lyrical feelings that had fevered his blood among the dandelions.

Gatsby	Zeddy	What a crazy world! He must have passed us drinking at the bar. Wish I’d seen him. Would have had him drinking with us. And maybe we would have avoided that stinking row. Maybe and maybe not Can’t tell about [MASK].

Sodapop	Jerco	“I won’t put a handk’chief o’ yourn in the [ 254] hock shop,” said [MASK]. “You’ll need you’ stuff soon as you get better. Specially you’ coat. You kain’t go anywheres without it.”

Ralph	Jake	He got it and went to play. . . . [MASK] finished playing with five dollars. He repaid the waiter and said: “Youse a good sport. I’ll always look out for you in that theah hole.” The waiter smiled. He was very friendly.

Luna	Jake	She danced a jag-[31] ging jig before him that made the giggles rise like a wave in the room. The pansies stared and tightened their grip on their dandies. The dandies tightened their hold on themselves. They looked the favored [MASK] up and down.

Passion	Man	Thou hast left behind Powers that will work for thee, air, earth, and skies; There’s not a breathing of the common wind That will forget thee; thou hast great allies; Thy friends are exultations, agonies, And love, and [MASK]’s unconquerable Mind.”

Dilsey	Jake	[MASK] turned to the pantryman: “But it was sure peculiar, though, how them aiggs just fly outa that kitchen lak that way.” “Maybe they all hatched and growed wings when ole black bull was playing with that sweet yaller piece,” the pantryman laughed.

Khofre	Zeddy	“Don’t I knows it? What else you think made me leave over the other side? And dog mah doggone ef I didn’t find it just as I landed.” “K-hhhhhhh! K-hhhhhhhh I” [MASK] laughed. “Dog mah cats!

Myrtle	Susy	I know them all, yet I don’t feel a bit haughty mixing here with [MASK] and you all.” “I guess you don’t now,” somebody said. Gin went round . . . and round . . . and round. . . .

Mammy	Zeddy	“Buddy, you looks so good to me, I could kish you,” [MASK] said. “Where?” “Everywhere. . . . French style.” “One on one cheek and one on the other.” “Savee-vous?”

Jimmy	Zeddy	In din- [50] ing- and sitting-room, five tables were occupied by card-players. Railroad porters, longshoremen, waiters; tight-faced, anxious-eyed. [MASK] sat at the same table with the lady of the flat.

Myrtle	Jake	There were green benches also lined round the vast dancing space. The music stopped with an abrupt clash just as [MASK] entered. Couples and groups were drinking at tables. Deftly, quickly the waiters slipped a way through the tables to serve and collect the money before the next dance. . . .

Bacardi	Muscatel	At one table a big-built, very black man was amusing himself with two attractive girls, one brownskinned and the other yellow. The girls’ complexion was heightened by High-Brown Talc powder and rouge. A bottle of [MASK] stood on the table.

her	Felice	This lucky charm was an old plaited necklace, leathery in appearance, with a large, [312] antique blue bead attached to it, that [MASK]’s grandmother (who had superintended her coming into the world) had given to her immediately after that event.

Ratso	Ray	Delicious food. The waiters fell to it with keen relish. Obliterated from their memory the sewer-incident of the moment before. . . . Feeding, feeding, feeding. But [MASK] remembered and visualized, and his stomach turned.

Pudd'nhead	Jake	She looked behind the curtain where his clothes were hanging and remarked his old English suit. Then she regarded archly his new nigger-brown rig-out. “You was moh illegant in that other, but I likes you in this all the same.” [MASK] laughed.

Johnny	Jake	One iron-heavy, blue-black lad (he was called Liver-lip behind his back, because of the plankiness of his lips) carried his arm in a sling, and told [MASK] how he happened to be like that.

Johnny	Jake	“He’s a good boy,” she agreed. She asked [MASK] about the railroad. “It must be lots of fun to ride from one town to the other like that. I’d love it, for I love to travel.

The stokers	Jake	The stokers’ bunks were lousy, and fetid with the mingled smell of stale food and water-closet. [MASK] had attempted to keep the place clean, but to do that was impossible. Apparently the Arabs thought that a sleeping quarters could also serve as a garbage can.

Johnny	Ray	[MASK] mentioned that he had to quit his bed because he couldn’t sleep. “This here town is the rottenest lay-over in the whole railroad field,” declared the light-yellow. “I don’t never sleep in the quarters here.”

Jim	Jake	[MASK] laughed. “What won’t a bad nigger do when he’s good and mean way down in his heart? I ain’t ’lowing mahself careless with none o’ that kind, chappie.” Two Pullman porters came into the dining-car in the middle of the waiters’ meal.

Hoover	Ray	“A man’s heart is cold dead when he has women doing that for him. How can a man live that way [ 240] and strut in public, instead of hiding himself underground like a worm?” He turned indignantly to [MASK].

Darcy	Ray	“A seaman’s life is no good, chappie, and it’s easier to jump [267] off a train in the field than offn a ship gwine across the pond.” “Maybe it’s not so bad in the mess,” suggested [MASK].

Cora	Dandies	[MASK] and pansies, chocolate, chestnut, coffee, ebony, cream, yellow, everybody was teased up to the high point of excitement. . . . “Crazy, plumb crazy about a man, mah man. . . The saxophone was moaning it.

Stephen	Jake	It was a day like this we romped in the grass ... a night as soft and intimate as this on which we forgot the world and ourselves. . . . Hours of pagan abandon, celebrating ourselves. . . . And [MASK] felt as all men who love love for love’s sake can feel.

Myrtle	Jake	But when she took it up to him she found that [MASK] was out. Returning to the kitchen, she [ 217] stumbled and broke the white bowl, made a sign with her rabbit foot, and murmured, foggily: “Theah’s sure a cross coming to thisa house.

Pecola	Felice	Negroes are like trees. They wear all colors naturally. And [MASK], rouged to a ravishing maroon, and wearing a close-fitting, chrome-orange frock and cork-brown slippers, just melted into the scene.

Cherry	Billy	Guess [MASK] is right toting his silent dawg around with him. He’s gotta, though, when he’s running a gambling joint. All the same, I gambles mahself and you nevah know when niggers am gwineta git crazy-mad.

Tom	Jake	The street was animated with dark figures going up, going down. Houses and men, women, and squinting cats and slinking dogs, everything seemed touched with soot and steel dust. “So this heah is the niggers’ run,” said [MASK].

Darry	Wese	“I hopes she don’t get bad,” he said. “For we ain’t got a cent o’ money. [MASK] just in on a streak o’ bad luck.” “I guess she’ll soon be all right,” I said.

Stephen	Jake	foh who?” The bell rang and rang again and again in spite of the notice: Ring once. And when the landlady opened the door and saw [MASK] supported between two men, she knew that the broken white bowl was for him and that his time was come.

Meeks	Zeddy	Oh, “blues,” “blues,” “blues.” Blackframed white grinning. Finger-snapping. Undertone singing. The three men with women teasing the stags. [MASK]’s gorilla feet dancing down the dark death lurking in his heart.

Eloise	Jerco	The door was slightly open, so I slipped in without knocking. I saw [MASK] kneeling down by the open wardrobe and kissing the toe of one of her brown shoes. He started as he saw me, and [ 257 ] looked queer kneeling there.

Janie	Rosalind	“I wouldn’t touch not one of her things until she’s better,” he said. “I’d sooner hock the shirt off mah back.” Which he was preparing to do. He had three expensive striped silk shirts, presents from [MASK].

Sutter	Jake	“It was a good thing you had you’ gun, though, honey, or------ O Lawd! what mighta happened!” “Oh, I woulda been a dead nigger this time or a helpless one,” [MASK] laughed and hugged her closer to him.

Dilsey	Susy	“I done have a mess of knowledge ’bout men tucked away heah.” [MASK] tapped her head of tight-rolled kinks knotted with scraps of ribbon of different colors. “I pays foh what I know and I’ve nevah been sorry, either.

Race	Jake	He ought to if he had a shred of social morality in him. They were all chain-ganged together and he was counted as one link. Yet he loathed every soul in that great barrack-room, except [MASK]. Race. . . .

Huckleberry Finn	Jake	“With all a that scabbing is a low-down deal,” [MASK] maintained. “Me eyel Seems lak youse gittin’ religion, boh. Youse talking death, tha’s what you sure is. One thing I know is niggers am made foh life.

Cherry	Jake	and I’ll tell it to the wo’1’—all the crackers, all them poah white trash, all the nigger-hitting and nigger-breaking white folks—I loves life and I got to live and I’ll scab through hell to live.” [MASK] did not work again that week.

Congo	Rumor	In all the better places it was banned. [MASK] said it was a police ban. It was an old tune, so far as popular tunes go. But at the Congo it lived fresh and green as grass. Everybody there was giggling and wriggling to it.

Jim	Jake	Not nearly as awful as French, though, [MASK] horse-laughed, vividly remembering the popular French styles. Broad-pleated, long-waisted, tight-bottomed pants and close-waisted coats whose breast pockets stick out their little comic signs of color. .

Eddie	Lean	And the pianist! At intervals his yellow [93] eyes, almost bloodshot, swept the cabaret with a triumphant glow, gave the dancers a caressing look, and returned to the ceiling. [MASK], smart fingers beating barbaric beauty out of a white frame.

didn't	nevah	So I jest stayed on and gived him a li’l’ loving, honey, but I [MASK] did tuk him to mah haht.” “It’s awright, sweetness. What do I care so long as wese got one another again?”

Jerry	Jake	I’m in no mood for the leg-show tonight, and the colored show is bum. Guess I’ll go sleep if I can.” “Awright, I’ll see you li’l’ later, chappie.” [MASK] gripped his hand.

Gatsby	Agatha	And he hated [MASK] and, for escape, wrapped himself darkly in self-love. Oh, he was scared of that long red steel cage whose rumbling rollers were eternally heavy-lipped upon shining, continent-circling rods.

Cherry	Ray	“He ain’t regular— you get me? And I want him treated right” “He’ll be treated better here than he would in church.” She laughed and touched [MASK]’s calf with the point of her slipper.

The Treeing of the Chef	Jake	Broiling tender corn-fed chicken without biting a leg. Thus, grimly, the chef existed. Humored and tolerated by the steward and hated by the waiters and undercooks. [MASK] [ 162 ] The Treeing of the Chef found himself on the side of the waiters.

Sandy	Rosalind	“You’ll need you’ stuff soon as you get better. Specially you’ coat. You kain’t go anywheres without it.” “S’posin’ I don’t get up again,” [MASK] smiled. But her countenance changed suddenly as she held her side and moaned.

J.W.	Ray	The waiters thought that he had one of his ornery spells on and was intentionally punishing them. They were all standing in the pantry, except [MASK]. The fifth said to the first: “Ask him why he don’t put the grub in the hole, partner.

the African Prince	Jake	She smoothed out her frock, arranged her hair, and put the turban on. “Come along to the Congo a little later,” she said to [MASK]. “Let’s celebrate on champagne.” The door closed on him. . . .

Matthew	Jake	And [MASK] was a high favorite wherever he went. There was something so naturally beautiful about his presence that everybody liked and desired him. Buddies, on the slightest provocation, were ready to fight for him, and the girls liked to make an argument around him.

Johnny	Jake	I remimber when I was gwine with a money gang that hed no use foh nothing but the pipe. That theah time was life, buddy.” “Wha’ sorta pipe was that there?” asked [MASK]. “The Chinese stuff, old boy.”

Tom	Jake	If you, and the whole strong race of workingman who live freely like you, don’t pay some attention to them, then you’ll all wither away and rot like weeds.” “Let us pray!” said [MASK]. "That I don’t believe in.”

Wintermute	Bowers	“[MASK]’ cabaret was some place for the [64] Myrtle Avenue teasing-brown pick-me-up then, brother—and the snow. The stuff was cheap then. You sniff, boh?”

He	Jake	For the moment, just as she was, she was desirable and provoked responses in him. He shuffled up to the couch and caressed her. “Leave me alone, I’m tired,” she snarled. The rebuff hurt [MASK]. “You slut!”

Monsieur Rieux	Sleep	[MASK] capitulated. Immediately he was back home again. His father’s house was a vast forest full of blooming hibiscus and mimosas and giant evergreen trees. And he was a gay humming-bird, fluttering and darting his long needle beak into the heart of a bell-flower.

Della	Jake	Burning now in [MASK]’s sweet blood. . . . He woke up in the morning in a state of perfect peace. She brought him hot coffee and cream and doughnuts. He yawned. He sighed. He was satisfied. He breakfasted. He washed.

Sai	Jake	“Honest, though, how do you think it happened?” persisted [MASK]. “Did you hoodoo them aiggs, or what did you do?” “I wouldn’t know atall. Better ask them rats in the yards ef they sucked the shells dry.

Jake	Susy	“He was kept, all right,” they said, “kept under ‘Gin-head’ [MASK]’s skirt.” He had had to fight a fellow in Dixie Red’s pool-room, for calling him a “skirt-man.”

Two-Bit	Jake	It’s the last ditch, where dogs go to die. When you drop down in that you cease being human.” “You done said it straight out, brother,” said [MASK]. “It’s a stinking life and I don’t like stinks.”

Heck	Jerco	“They did seem quiet as lambs, although they was always havin’ company. But Ise got to speak to them, ’cause I doana wanta lose ma young mens. . . . But theyse a real nice-acting couple. [MASK] him treats me like him was mah son.

John	Billy	Order that theah ovah-water liquor you useter be so dippy about. That theah Scotch.” “I ain’t quite all right, [MASK]. Gotta go slow on the booze.” “Whasmat? . . . Oh, foh Gawd’s sake!

Miss Havisham	Melachrino	There were [MASK] stubs lying about and his bottle of Scotch was on the mantelpiece. Evidently the strange visitor of the week before had been there again. “Hello!” She yawned and flicked off her cigarette ash and continued smoking.

his honey daddy	Jake	“There ain’t no yaller gal gwine get mah honey daddy thisanight.” She took [MASK]’s arm and cuddled up against his side. “Aw no, sweetness. I was dogging it with one and jest drops her flat when I seen you.”

Pearl	Susy	But when [MASK] came home from work one evening and found that her latest “yaller” sweetie had stolen her suitcase and best dresses and pawned even her gas range, she resolved never to keep another of his kind as a “steady.”

Jake	Gawd	I knowed her long before you. For [MASK]’s sake quit you’ fooling and don’t let’s bust up the man’s cabaret.” All the fashionable folk had already fled. “She’s my woman and I’ll carve any damn-fool nigger for her.”

Johnny	Ray	Wese all just lumped together without a chanst to choose and so we nacherally hate one another. It’s nothing to wonder that you’ buddy [MASK] done runned away from it. Why, jest the other night I witnessed a nasty stroke.

Dana	Rose	That plug-ugly black woman is ornery like hell. I ain’t gwineta let her bridle and ride me. . . . You ain’t in no pickle like that with [MASK], is you?” “Lawd, no! I do as I wanta.

Jay Gatsby	Jake	And the dapper escort tried to be obviously unconcerned. At the bar the three pals had finished one round and the bar-man was in the act of pouring another when a loud scream tore through music and conversation. [MASK] knew that voice and dashed down the stairs.

Joe's	Bowman	You know the fourth had to lay off this trip.” “You don’t say!” “Yes, he’s got a mean one. And the second cook on [MASK]’s diner he’s been in a chronic way for about three months.”

Dave	Jake	Suddenly he heard sharp, deep, distressful grunts, and saw behind some barrels a black man down and being kicked perilously in the rear end by two white men. [MASK] drew his hook from his belt and, waving it in the air, he rushed them.

Dennis	Jake	“I can’t find a nickel foh car fare,” said the boy. [MASK] took him into a saloon and bought him a lemon squash. “Drink that to clear you’ haid,” he said. “And heah’s car fare.”

Dallas	Jake	Opened, it showed a cerise blouse and a yellow-and-mauve check skirt. Her head of thoroughly-straightened hair flaunted a green hat with a decoration of red ostrich plumes. “Great balls of fire! Here’s you doom, buddy,” said [MASK].

Jim	Jerco	I thought I was pretty well fixed for such [248] a hard winter. All I had to do as extra work was keeping the saloon clean. . . . One afternoon [MASK] came into the saloon with a man who looked pretty near white.

William	Jake	Transient rhythms that touch and pass you, unrememberable, and rhythms un-forgetable. Imperial rhythms whose vivid splendor blinds your sight and destroys your taste for lesser ones. [MASK] possessed a sure instinct for the right rhythm. He was connoisseur enough.

Stan	Billy	“Beer!” exclaimed [MASK]. “Quit you fooling and take some real liquor, nigger. Ise paying foh it. Order that theah ovah-water liquor you useter be so dippy about. That theah Scotch.”

Pippin	Zeddy	The high wave of joyful excitement had subsided and the customers sat casually drinking and gossiping as if they had not been soaring a minute before in a realm of pure joy. From his place, giving a good view of the staircase, [MASK] saw two apparently familiar long legs swinging down the steps.

Johnny	Zeddy	“What he’s got on that black back of his’n he can have,” she had said while throwing the things in the bag. [MASK] beat on the door with his fists. [ ioo] “Wha moh you want?”

Jim	Man	These men claimed kinship with him. They were black like him. [MASK] and nature had put them in the same race. He ought to love them and feel them (if they felt anything). He ought to if he had a shred of social morality in him.

Jimmy	Philly	“Here you is, boh. Whether youse well or sick, them’s after you.” “Is they? Lemme see. Hm . . . [MASK].” • • • “Who is you’ pen-pusher?”

Effie	Susy	and bed. [MASK] was splendid in her matriarchal way, rolling her eyes with love or disapproval at him, according to the exigencies of the moment. The Saturday-night gin parties went on as usual. The brown and high-brown boys came and swilled.

Soda	Zeddy	Since then he had had many other alliances. But none had been successful. It was true that no Black Belt beauty would ever call [MASK] “mah han’some brown.” But there were sweetmen of the Belt more repulsive than he, that women would fight and murder each other for.

Daisy	Susy	[MASK] was jealous of him in the proprietary sense. She believed in free love all right, but not for the man she possessed and supported. She warned him against the ornery hussies of her race. [82]

Laura	Billy	Her partner, at [MASK]’s table, sucked his iced creme-de-menthe through a straw. The high wave of joyful excitement had subsided and the customers sat casually drinking and gossiping as if they had not been soaring a minute before in a realm of pure joy.

Bbrenda	Jake	[MASK] replied. She moved down on him like a panther, swinging her hips in a wonderful, rhythmical motion. She sprang upon his neck and brought him down. “Oh, honey, you ain’t mad at me ’counta the little fuss tonight?”

Jadine	Jake	As they entered [MASK] was greeted by a mulatto woman in the full vigor of middle life. “Why, you heart-breaker! It’s ages and ages since I saw you. You and me sure going to have a bust-up tonight.”

Tanisha	Theah	[MASK]’s sweet hell playing in the back yard.” The girls rushed to the window and saw the two black women squaring off at each other down in the back yard. They were stark naked. After the challenge, the women had decided to fight with their clothes off.

Dave	Jake	“Oh, the food is all right,” said [MASK]. “I watch him close anough in that there kitchen, [ i73] and he knows I ain’t standing in with him in no low-down stuff.”

He	Jake	He called him “chappie” in a genial, semi-paternal way. [MASK]’s life had never before touched any of the educated of the ten dark millions. He had, however, a vague idea of who they were..

Cotton	Jake	“Oh, ma-mal” [MASK] licked his lips. “So youse all fixed up in this heah town?” “Not going there tonight, though,” the light-yellow said in a careless, almost bored tone. “Too far for mine.”

Gatsby	Jake	The gos-[ 215 ] sip was good. [MASK] changed to Scotch and asked for the siphon. He had finished the first Scotch and asked for another, when a pain gripped his belly with a wrench that almost tore him apart.

Barnes	Rosalind	They said they couldn’t sleep there comfortably together on account of the goings-on in [MASK]’s room. The fellows were members of the Colored Y. M. C. A. and were queerly quiet and pious. One of them was [ 250] studying to be a preacher.

Benjy	nevah	“What you wanta go knocking around them foreign countries again for like swallow come and swallow go from year to year and [MASK] settling down no place? This heah is you’ country, daddy. What you gwine away from it for?” “
