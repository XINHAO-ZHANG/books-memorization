Code and data to support the paper  -- Remember to forget: A study on verbatim memorization of literature in Large Language Models

This study probes the memorisation of books in English and French of open-source language models, specifically examining the extent to which these models have internalized English and French literature. Utilizing the name cloze inference methodology pioneered by [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00118), we extend the analysis to evaluate the models' capacity for verbatim recall of literary texts in French.
